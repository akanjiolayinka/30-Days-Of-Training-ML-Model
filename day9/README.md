# Day 9: Unified Dataset Exploration & Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores a comprehensive unified dataset containing diverse features from multiple domains integrated into a single analytical framework. The focus is on discovering hidden patterns, relationships between variables, and extracting meaningful insights through extensive exploratory data analysis and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Dataset

**File:** `UnifiedDataset.csv`

**Description:** Multi-domain integrated dataset with various numerical and categorical features

**Key Characteristics:**
- Mixed data types (numerical, categorical, temporal)
- Multi-domain feature integration
- Potential for pattern discovery and clustering
- Rich feature set for comprehensive analysis
- Suitable for both supervised and unsupervised learning

## Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Data quality assessment (missing values, outliers, duplicates)
   - Univariate analysis of each feature's distribution
   - Bivariate and multivariate relationship exploration
   - Statistical summary and descriptive analytics

2. **Pattern Discovery:**
   - Correlation analysis to identify feature relationships
   - Clustering to discover natural groupings
   - Dimensionality reduction for visualization (PCA, t-SNE)
   - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns

3. **Feature Analysis:**
   - Feature importance and relevance scoring
   - Interaction effects between variables
   - Temporal patterns if time-based features present
   - Categorical vs numerical feature relationships

4. **Insight Extraction:**
   - Segment profiling and characterization
   - Key drivers and influencing factors
   - Business/domain-specific insights
   - Data storytelling and narrative building

## Analysis Techniques

- Comprehensive statistical profiling
- Correlation matrices and heatmaps
- Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
- Outlier detection methods (IQR, Z-score, Isolation Forest)
- Interactive visualizations with Plotly
- Hypothesis testing for group comparisons

## Expected Outcomes

- Detailed data quality report
- Interactive correlation and distribution dashboards
- Cluster analysis with segment profiles
- 2D/3D visualizations of data structure
- Comprehensive insights document
- Identified key patterns and anomalies
- Feature engineering recommendations
- Potential use cases for predictive modeling

## Visualizations

- Correlation heatmaps with hierarchical clustering
- Distribution plots (histograms, KDE, box plots)
- Scatter plot matrices for multivariate exploration
- PCA/t-SNE embeddings with cluster colors
- Feature importance rankings
- Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities
- Temporal trend lines (if applicable)

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Unified dataset with preprocessing artifacts
- `models/` - Clustering models, dimensionality reducers, scalers
- `notebooks/` - EDA, clustering, and insight extraction notebooks
- `viz/` - Interactive plots, dashboards, statistical graphics

## Getting Started

Begin with the comprehensive EDA notebook to understand the dataset structure, then explore clustering and dimensionality reduction notebooks to discover hidden patterns and groupings in the data.
