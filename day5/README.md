# Day 5: Healthcare Staff & Patients Management System

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive hospital management system with multiple interconnected datasets covering patients, staff, services, and scheduling. The analysis focuses on operational efficiency, resource utilization, patient-staff relationships, and service delivery optimization.

## Datasets

**Files:** 
1. `patients.csv` - Patient demographics and medical records
2. `staff.csv` - Healthcare staff information and specializations
3. `services_weekly.csv` - Weekly service delivery metrics
4. `staff_schedule.csv` - Staff scheduling and shift patterns

**Key Features:**
- Patient demographics, admission dates, medical conditions
- Staff roles, departments, experience levels, availability
- Service types, frequency, and weekly performance metrics
- Scheduling patterns, shift assignments, workload distribution

## Objectives

1. **Patient Analysis:**
   - Demographic profiling and admission patterns
   - Disease prevalence and treatment outcomes
   - Patient flow and length of stay analysis
   - Readmission rate examination

2. **Staff Performance & Utilization:**
   - Staff-to-patient ratios by department
   - Workload distribution and efficiency metrics
   - Specialization vs demand matching
   - Shift pattern optimization

3. **Service Delivery Optimization:**
   - Weekly service trends and capacity planning
   - Peak demand periods identification
   - Resource allocation recommendations
   - Department-wise performance metrics

4. **Integrated Analytics:**
   - Patient-staff assignment patterns
   - Scheduling efficiency vs patient satisfaction
   - Cross-departmental workflow analysis
   - Predictive modeling for resource planning

## Analysis Techniques

- Multi-table data integration and relationship mapping
- Time series analysis for trends and seasonality
- Clustering for patient segmentation
- Staff scheduling optimization algorithms
- Predictive modeling for demand forecasting
- Network analysis for patient-staff interactions

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive dashboard of hospital operations
- Staff utilization heatmaps and efficiency reports
- Patient flow visualizations and bottleneck identification
- Optimized scheduling recommendations
- Predictive models for patient admissions and resource needs
- Actionable insights for operational improvements

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Four interconnected healthcare datasets
- `models/` - Predictive models for forecasting and optimization
- `notebooks/` - Multi-dataset analysis and integration notebooks
- `viz/` - Dashboards, timelines, network graphs, heatmaps

## Getting Started

Begin with the EDA notebook to understand data relationships, then explore the integrated analysis for comprehensive insights into hospital operations.
